        <p>Hey! My name is Dan.<br></br>
          I'm a 28 year old web developer.<br></br>
          I'm passionate about building in the crypto/web3 community and became a developer because of this passion.<br></br>
          It is my goal to get involved with or start a project in the space in the near future.<br></br>
          Offline I enjoy practicing yoga, playing guitar, swimming in the ocean, playing golf, drinking coffee and eating meals with my friends.<br></br>
          I also play several musical instruments.<br></br>
