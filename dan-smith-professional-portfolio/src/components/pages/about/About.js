        <p>Hey! My name is Dan.
          I'm a 28 year old web developer. 
          I'm passionate about building in the crypto/web3 community and became a developer because of this passion.
          It is my goal to get involved with or start a project in the space in the near future.
          Offline I enjoy practicing yoga, playing guitar, swimming in the ocean, playing golf, drinking coffee and eating meals with my friends.
          I also play several musical instruments and am known to lay down a mean rap from time to time.
        </p>
