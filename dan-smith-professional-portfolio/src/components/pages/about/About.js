        <p>Hey! My name is Dan.<br></br>
          I'm a 28 year old web developer.<br></br>
          I have recently completed a 6 month, intensive full stack developer bootcamp with the University of Sydney and Trilogy Education Services where I achieved the highest grade in project work of my cohort (99.33%).<br></br>
          I also have a Bachelor of Commerce degree from the University of Adelaide where I majored in Corporate Finance.
          It is my next goal to secure an exciting and challenging role where I can learn and grow as a developer.<br></br>
          Offline I enjoy practicing yoga, playing guitar, swimming in the ocean, playing golf, drinking coffee and eating meals with my friends.<br></br>
          I also play several musical instruments.<br></br>
        </p>
